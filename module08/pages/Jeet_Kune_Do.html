          Jeet Kune Do, The way of the intercepting fist in Cantonese, abbreviated JKD, is a hybrid philosophy of martial arts heavily influenced by the personal philosophy and experiences of martial artist Bruce Lee. Lee, who founded the system on July 9, 1967,
          referred to it as "non-classical", suggesting that JKD is a form of Chinese Kung Fu, yet without form. Unlike more traditional martial arts, Jeet Kune Do is not fixed or patterned, and is a philosophy with guiding thoughts. It was named for
          the Wing Chun concept of interception or attacking while one's opponent is about to attack. Jeet Kune Do practitioners believe in minimal movement with maximum effect. On January 10, 1996, the Bruce Lee Foundation decided to use the name Jun
          Fan Jeet Kune Do to refer to the martial arts system which Lee founded; "Jun Fan" being Lee's Chinese given name.

          Bruce Lee believed that kata forms and martial art tournament matches alike (like Karate) were simply "organised despair". He believed that in order to "fully express oneself, one must" "have no limitations" (kata and rigid and non-flowing movements being
          the limitation). His system was revolutionary, and included all possible forms of strikes: attacks to the groin, finger jab to the eye.
        </p>

          The following are principles that Lee incorporated into Jeet Kune Do. Lee felt these were universal combat truths that were self-evident, and would lead to combat success if followed. Familiarity with each of the "Four ranges of combat", in particular,
          is thought to be instrumental in becoming a "total" martial artist. JKD teaches that the best defense is a strong offense, hence the principle of an "intercepting fist". For someone to attack another hand-to-hand, the attacker must approach
          the target. This provides an opportunity for the attacked person to "intercept" the attacking movement. The principle of interception may be applied to more than intercepting physical attacks; non-verbal cues (subtle movements that an opponent
          may be unaware of) may also be perceived or "intercepted", and thus be used to one's advantage. The "Five ways of attack", categories which help JKD practitioners organize their fighting repertoire, comprise the offensive teachings of JKD. The
          concepts of "Stop hits & stop kicks", and "Simultaneous parrying & punching", based on the concept of single fluid motions which attack while defending (in systems such as Epee fencing and Wing Chun), compose the defensive teachings of JKD.
          These concepts were modified for unarmed combat and implemented into the JKD framework by Lee to complement the principle of interception.

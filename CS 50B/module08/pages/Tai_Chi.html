          Tai chi (taiji) is an internal Chinese martial art practiced for both its defense training and its health benefits. The term taiji refers to a philosophy of the forces of yin and yang, related to the moves. Though originally conceived as a martial art,
          it is also typically practiced for a variety of other personal reasons: competitive wrestling in the format of pushing hands (tui shou), demonstration competitions and achieving greater longevity. As a result, a multitude of training forms exist,
          both traditional and modern, which correspond to those aims with differing emphasis. Some training forms of tàijíquán are especially known for being practiced with relatively slow movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept of the taiji ("supreme ultimate"), in contrast with wuji ("without ultimate"), appears in both Taoist and Confucian Chinese philosophy, where it represents the fusion or mother of yin and yang into a single ultimate, represented by the taijitu
          symbol Taijitu. Taijiquan theory and practice evolved in agreement with many Chinese philosophical principles, including those of Taoism and Confucianism.
        </p>

          Qigong involves coordinated movement, breath, and awareness used for health, meditation, and martial arts training. While many scholars and practitioners consider taijiquan to be a type of qigong, the two are commonly distinguished as separate but closely
          related practices, with qigong playing an important role in training for taijiquan, and with many taijiquan movements performed as part of qigong practice. The focus of qigong is typically more on health or meditation than martial applications.
          Internally the main difference is the flow of qi. In qigong, the flow of qi is held at a gate point for a moment to aid the opening and cleansing of the channels. In taijiquan, the flow of qi is continuous, thus allowing the development of power
          for the use by the practitioner.

          Tai chi has been reported as being useful in treating a number of human ailments, and is supported by a number of associations, including the National Parkinson Foundation and Diabetes Australia. However, medical evidence of effectiveness was lacking
          and in recent years research has been undertaken to address this. A 2017 systematic review found that it decreased the risk of falls in older people.
        </p>
        <p>
          A 2011 comprehensive overview of systematic reviews of tai chi recommended tai chi to older people for its various physical and psychological benefits. There was no conclusive evidence of benefit for any of the other conditions researched, including Parkinson's
          disease, diabetes, cancer and arthritis.
        </p>
        <p>
          A 2015 systematic review found tai chi could be performed by those with chronic medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, and osteoarthritis without worsening shortness of breath and pain, and found favorable effects
          on functional exercise capacity in people with these conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2015 the Australian Government's Department of Health published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by health insurance; tai-chi was one of 17 therapies evaluated and the
          conclusion was that there is very-low-quality evidence to suggest that tai chi may have some beneficial health effects when compared to control in a limited number of populations for a limited number of outcomes.
